* Institutions: have a set of rules
* Norms: A set of guidelines
* Values: A generalized set of guidelines
* August Comte coined the term _Sociology_.
* Emile Durkheim(french) dicussed the subject matter of sociology.

## Charles Wright Mills- Sociological Imagination
* That nigga was an american born in texas and a political sociologist and lit up the concept of _sociological imagination_.
* That nigga wrote _The Power Elite_, _Sociological Imagination_, _White Collar: American Middle class_
* Its major question was **"HOW	the focus of an individual can be laid on a broader perspective of society and by what means?"**
* For better quality of unserstanding of the society one needs to posses _the right quality of mind_ whic helps to look beyond the private sphere, to locate in the broader society.
* This right quality of mind is called the Sociological Imagination
* With the lack of sociological imagination the society will disintegrate
* He says our lives are traps it mean we ain't able to ...
* It capacitates the required shift from one to another perspectives
* ------Three essential questions---------
  * (i) --What is the structure of the society?
  * (ii) -Where does this society stand in human history?
  * (iii) What kind of humans inhabit this society and if they have the ability to stand up to make it better?
* What promotes 
* Adopt the innovative idea(if we have one); (i don't get it, without any claims and reliable proofs why should i believe)
* It takes time to adopt the new idea, an instance is the time when earth was considered flat and there came a notion of round earth

----What i concluded in the class (and prof said) ITS ALL ABOUT PERSPECTIVE!-----

* It(socio-imagination) is about developing the right quality of mind that helps in looking out of private sphere
* It requires a shift from one perspective to another perspective
* Three essential questions:
structural society, institutional rules,

* A Very nice instance of it is provided in the movie- Tare Zameen Par, the teacher's perspective is something that demonstrates socio imag. as everyone before the entry of teacher is ignoring the child and considering and treating him as retarded and the teacher creates the difference
* We must understand where our society stands in history and civilization
* With a little persistence you can create a difference!


* Good Sociology:- It needs good understanding of structure

* Globalization is intensification of socialization

## How to inculcate Socio-Imagination
* A pre-req. for socio-imagination is an ability of a person to make distinctin between _personal trouble_ and _apublic issues_
 * Personal trouble foucses on small group relations.
   * It occurs when valur of an individual is threatened.
   * Ex.: unemploylment, divorce.

 * Public Troubles
   * Affects a large amount of people.

### Relevance of Socio-Imagination
* With sociological imag. an individual rises above his own miseries and sees them as a consequence of the changes taking place in the society as a whole
* This makes him to desist from being a victim of self pity that may lead to self destructing tendencies, even suicide.
* Socio imag. offers for development of _reflexivity_ facilitating to look at societ critically and identify its challenges and opportunities.
* Relevance->To understand our journey, about ourselves means you're not alone your parts are driven by sociol system and actions in which ouy're living.
* Durkheim wanted to make his country morally and politically strong via consolidation.
* He qwas against anarchy and social chaos and large part of his study dealt with social order .

## Durkheim-IMP!
* French nigga(Jew) born in Lorraine(france), lorraine was lost to Prussia(so he faced difficulty in growing up) determied to study society.
* Nigga faced discrimination that inculcated in himself insecurity and felt the lack of social solidarity(the reason for discrimination).
* He was keenly intereseted in defining subject matter of sociology as distinct from that of philosophy or biology.
* DURKHEIM TALKED ABOUT SUBJECT MATTER OF SOCIOLOGY(not august comte, this nigga just coined the term _Sociology_)!!!!
* He was against chaos and discrimination.
* Main area of his study was _Social Fact_.

## Durkheim's Contributions
* Great prolific writer.
* Wrote: _The division of labour in society_, _The rules of sociological method_, _Suicide(1897)_, _The elementary form of Religious Life(1912)_.

### Division of Labour-Durk's idea
* The division of labour in society was durkheims's doctoral thesis where he rejected Farwin's idea(the idea of _Survival of the Fittest_) that once the size of human population increases, there will be struggle for existence.
* He rejected teh explanation of divsion of labour advanced by the psychologist and economists.
* For him, the function of labour division is sociological. It contributes to social ..
* (It is something like separation of concerns and SRP:) )
* He believed that division is beneficial as it establishes social and moral order within the society.
* The major theme in this divsion are the differences between the primitive and advanced civilization and how they perceive social solidarity. Solidarity here means utilities of interest objectives and standards.
* Two solidarities- Mechanical(pre-modern people) & Organic(Modern people, but here all are inter-dependent)
* Basically, Organic Solidarity follows division of labour nicely(perceive it as SRP).
* Globalization is all about global inter-depenence.

### Mech-Solidarity(Pre-Modern traits)
* Strong Collective consciousness, have consensus. 
* Solidarity of resemblance.
* Individual labority wasn't present.
* Characterized by _repressive laws_ as crime is regarded as an offence against common conscience.

### Organic Solidarity(Modern-traits)
* Develops out of difference rather than lkeness among hte members of the modern societies.
* Characterized by individualism(SRP).
* Individuals are no longer similar but different, their mental and moral similarities disappear.
* It is held together by indiviauliztion of parts rather than by homogenity of elements.
* It is like _live and let live_. A network of relations.
* Characterized by weaking of collective conscience and _Restitutive law_.
* Purpose of law here is to teach a person the right unlike the mech. solidarity's repressive laws.
