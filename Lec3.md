## Charles Wright Mills- Sociological Imagination
* That nigga was an american born in texas and a political sociologist and lit up the concept of _sociological imagination_.
* That nigga wrote _The Power Elite_, _Sociological Imagination_, _White Collar: American Middle class_
* Its major question was **"HOW	the focus of an individual can be laid on a broader perspective of society and by what means?"**
* For better quality of unserstanding of the society one needs to posses _the right quality of mind_ whic helps to look beyond the private sphere, to locate in the broader society.
* This right quality of mind is called the Sociological Imagination

structural society, institutional rules,

* A Very nice instance of it is provided in the movie- Tare Zameen Par, the teacher's perspective is something that demonstrates socio imag. as everyone before the entry of teacher is ignoring the child and considering and treating him as retarded and the teacher creates the difference
