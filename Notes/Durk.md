## Durkheim's Contributions
* Great prolific writer.
* Wrote: _The division of labour in society_, _The rules of sociological method_, _Suicide(1897)_, _The elementary form of Religious Life(1912)_.
* His work ensure d that a separate place of Sociology as an independent discipline dute ot which during 1898 he setup a scholarly journal called _L'annee Sociologiqie_ which in course of time became successfull in promoting the Duekheimian brand of sociology to other school and academics.
* Due to his disciples, sociology advancedd in stature and has begun widely accepted in France as a distincitve discipline.

### Division of Labour-Durk's idea
* The division of labour in society was durkheims's doctoral thesis where he rejected Farwin's idea(the idea of _Survival of the Fittest_) that once the size of human population increases, there will be struggle for existence.
* He rejected teh explanation of divsion of labour advanced by the psychologist and economists.
* For him, the function of labour division is sociological. It contributes to social ..
* (It is something like separation of concerns and SRP:) )
* He believed that division is beneficial as it establishes social and moral order within the society.
* The major theme in this divsion are the differences between the primitive and advanced civilization and how they perceive social solidarity. Solidarity here means utilities of interest objectives and standards.
* Two solidarities- Mechanical(pre-modern people) & Organic(Modern people, but here all are inter-dependent)
* Basically, Organic Solidarity follows division of labour nicely(perceive it as SRP).
* Globalization is all about global inter-depenence.

### Mech-Solidarity(Pre-Modern traits)
* Strong Collective consciousness, have consensus. 
* Solidarity of resemblance.
* Individual labority wasn't present.
* Characterized by _repressive laws_ as crime is regarded as an offence against common conscience.
* Society is in the individual.
* Similar to simple organism or machine: inidividuals are mostly functionally equivalent and substitutable.

### Organic Solidarity(Modern-traits)
* Develops out of difference rather than lkeness among hte members of the modern societies.
* Characterized by individualism(SRP).
* Individuals are no longer similar but different, their mental and moral similarities disappear.
* It is held together by indiviauliztion of parts rather than by homogenity of elements.
* It is like _live and let live_. A network of relations.
* Characterized by weaking of collective conscience and _Restitutive law_.
* Purpose of law here is to teach a person the right unlike the mech. solidarity's repressive laws.
* The individual is in the society.
* Similar to complex organisms, organs ain't interchangeable.

### The Rules of Sociological Method(Book by Durk 1895)
* His second book _The Rules of Sociological Method(1895)_ defined sociology as teh study of social facts, which are actions of society(a/c to durk).
* Social facts do not originiate in the individual but in the ccollectiviy , in the collective mind.
* He was particularly interested in shpwinfg that function of social fact is moral. Social Institutio work to produce the great.


**Social Facts:** 
* Values, cult norms and social structures that transcend the individual and can exercise social control.
* These are external to an individual, means constrained to the individual and show property of generalizability.
* What is a social fact in one cult can be abhorrently srtange in another; by keeping in mind how society influences your beliefs, you can temper your reactions to what is different.
* Examples: Marriage, Language, Religion.

### Suicide(1897)
* Durk's understanding of social fact provided an emphasis in the study of _Suicide(1897)_.
* Fact: Suicide rate of _Catholics_ was lesser than that of _Protestants_!
* Read more about Durk's ideology on suicide [here](./Suicide.md).

### The Elementary Forms of Religious Life(1912)
* His last major book(the aforementioned), is often regarded as the most profound and the most original of his works.
* It contains description and detailed analysis of the clan system and totemism in the Arunta tribe of Australian aborigines.
* He elaborates a general form of religion derived from the study of the simplest and most primitive religious insitution.
