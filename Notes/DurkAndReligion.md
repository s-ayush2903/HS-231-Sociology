## Durkheim and Religion
* He defined religion as a unified system of belief and practices.
* A/c to him, the essence of religion is a division of world into two kind of phenomena, the _sacred_ and the _profane_.
* Sacred refers to things humans being set apart including religious belief, rites duties or any other socially defined as requiring as special religious treatment.
* Almmost anything cab ve sacred- a god, a rock, a tree an animal or a bird etc.
* These are sacred only beacuse they become the symbol of religious belief, sentiments and practices across various communities.
* "The sacred thing" authored by him is par excellence that which the profane should not touch and cannot touch with impurity.
* Profane is the reverse of sacred.
* It embraces those ideas, persons, practices, things that are everyday attitude of commonness, utility and familiarity.
* THe unholy or profane is believed to contaminate the holy or sacred.
* It is perceived that the sacred symbol of religious belief and practices refer, not to the external environment oe to individual human nature but only to the moral reality of society.

## Totemism
* A/c to Durk, _Totem_ refers to an implicit belief in a mysterious or sacred force or principle that provides sanction for violation of taboos.
* It inculcates moral responsibility in the group and animates the totem itself/
* [Totemism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/totemism-religion) is the religion, not of certain animals or of certain man or of certain images, but a kind of anonymous force.
* In his analysis and findings of religion among Arunta tribes of [Australisan aborigines](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=aborigines), instead of other form of religion like [_Animism_](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=animisn) and [_Naturism_](https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/naturism).
* Durk took _Totemism_ as the key concept to explain the origin of religion.
* Durk believed that he resolved the religious-moral dilemma of modern society. If religion is nothing but an indirect worship of society, the modern civilizations only need to express their religious sentiments directly towards the sacred symbolization of society.
* He believed that the society has divinized religion. 
* He stated that dieties that men worship together are only projection of power of society.
* Therefore, religious as a social instution serves to give meaning to man's existential [predicaments](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=predicament).
