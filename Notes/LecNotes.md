* Values: A generalized set of guidelines
* August Comte coined the term _Sociology_.

## Charles Wright Mills- Sociological Imagination
* That nigga was an american born in texas and a political sociologist and lit up the concept of _sociological imagination_.
* That nigga wrote _The Power Elite_, _Sociological Imagination_, _White Collar: American Middle class_
* Its major question was **"HOW	the focus of an individual can be laid on a broader perspective of society and by what means?"**
* For better quality of unserstanding of the society one needs to posses _the right quality of mind_ whic helps to look beyond the private sphere, to locate in the broader society.
* This right quality of mind is called the Sociological Imagination
* With the lack of sociological imagination the society will disintegrate
* He says our lives are traps it mean we ain't able to ...
* It capacitates the required shift from one to another perspectives
* ------Three essential questions---------
  * (i) --What is the structure of the society?
  * (ii) -Where does this society stand in human history?
  * (iii) What kind of humans inhabit this society and if they have the ability to stand up to make it better?
* What promotes 
* Adopt the innovative idea(if we have one); (i don't get it, without any claims and reliable proofs why should i believe)
* It takes time to adopt the new idea, an instance is the time when earth was considered flat and there came a notion of round earth

----What i concluded in the class (and prof said) ITS ALL ABOUT PERSPECTIVE!-----

* It(socio-imagination) is about developing the right quality of mind that helps in looking out of private sphere
* It requires a shift from one perspective to another perspective
* Three essential questions:
structural society, institutional rules,
* A Very nice instance of it is provided in the movie- Tare Zameen Par, the teacher's perspective is something that demonstrates socio imag. as everyone before the entry of teacher is ignoring the child and considering and treating him as retarded and the teacher creates the difference
* We must understand where our society stands in history and civilization
* With a little persistence you can create a difference!



* Good Sociology:- It needs good understanding of structure
* Globalization is intensification of socialization

## How to inculcate Socio-Imagination

### Relevance of Socio-Imagination
* With sociological imag. an individual rises above his own miseries and sees them as a consequence of the changes taking place in the society as a whole
* This makes him to desist from being a victim of self pity that may lead to self destructing tendencies, even suicide.
* Socio imag. offers for development of _reflexivity_ facilitating to look at societ critically and identify its challenges and opportunities.
* Relevance->To understand our journey, about ourselves means you're not alone your parts are driven by sociol system and actions in which ouy're living.
* Durkheim wanted to make his country morally and politically strong via consolidation.
* He qwas against anarchy and social chaos and large part of his study dealt with social order .

## Durkheim-IMP!
* French nigga(Jew) born in Lorraine(france), lorraine was lost to Prussia(so he faced difficulty in growing up) determied to study society.
* Nigga faced discrimination that inculcated in himself insecurity and felt the lack of social solidarity(the reason for discrimination).
